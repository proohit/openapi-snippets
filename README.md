# OpenApi Snippets

## Usage

### snippets

currently supported snippets:

- `pathget`
- `pathpost`
- `pathput`
- `pathdelete`
- `schemaObject`
- `propertyObject`

### validation

JSON files are being validated according to their respective usage (e.g. Schema Objects). For schema specifications, see [OpenApi Specification v3 ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/schemas/v3.0/schema.json)

For IntelliSense to validate the files, filenames have to match their respective schema:
Object Type|filename
--- |---
schemaObject| \*-schema.json
Path Item|\*-path.json

You can navigate through predefined anchor points with TAB key. This only works right after inserting a snippet.

### keybindings

You can configure custom keybindings for the snippets. For this, open the keybindings.json file of VS Code (Shortcut `Ctrl+K Ctrl+S`, then click on the `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` button in the upper right corner).
For any keybinding, use this template and edit the fields which are marked by `<<>>`:

```json
{
  "key": "<<Your desired shortcut>>",
  "command": "editor.action.insertSnippet",
  "when": "editorTextFocus",
  "args": {
    "langId": "json",
    "name": "<<Snippet prefix>>"
  }
}
```
For `name` you can use any [snippet prefix](#snippets).
